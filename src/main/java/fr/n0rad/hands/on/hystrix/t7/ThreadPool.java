public class ThreadPool {
//    HystrixThreadPoolKey.Factory.asKey("HelloWorldPool")
//
//    Here is a simple example:
//
//            2 commands used to access Video metadata
//
//    group name is "VideoMetadata"
//    command A goes against Cassandra
//    command B goes against memcached
//    If command A becomes latent and saturates its thread-pool it should not prevent command B
//    from executing requests since they each hit different backend resources.
//
//    Thus, we logically want these commands grouped together but want them isolated differently
//    and would use HystrixThreadPoolKey to give each of them a different thread-pool.
